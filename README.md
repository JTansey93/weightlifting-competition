# weightlifting-competition

This is a web application written using the Django framework.

The basic idea is to allow the user to run a weightlifting competition.

The database model defines a 'Competitor' with 3 attempts each for Snatch and Clean & Jerk.

The site has a home page, a page to view the competitor list, a page to add competitors, and a page to see the competition results.

Currenty the application is still in development.
